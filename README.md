The first part of the Reordering kata from [cyber-dojo.org](http://www.cyber-dojo.org/). Here are the instructions from that site, verbatim:

```
Given a set of integer numbers your task is to reorder them as follows:

Move a range of elements from one position to another, preserving their order and the order of the other elements.
   
   e.g. Given the set
   { 4, 2, 7, 5, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2 }
        ^     ^              ^
        s     e              p
   
moving the range of elements starting at element 2 (s) and ending at element 4 (e) to the position before element 9 (p) will give
   
   { 4, 9, 8, 6, 4, 2, 7, 5, 3, 2 }
                    ^     ^
                    s     e
```
